# ESP8266_MQTT_light
Micropython code for controlling an RGB and White light using an ESP8266 controller board of my design

This code is poorly written alpha code to control a 12 VDC RGB light and a 12 VDC white light over MQTT 
It works but needs improvement.  The controller board is on the <a href="https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/SDt1Jgl8"><img src="https://644db4de3505c40a0444-327723bce298e3ff5813fb42baeefbaa.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/5d04d3145cb8d8d68e20611b7c08b1a4.png" alt="OSH Park"></img></a> site.  
Being very new to ESP8266 and micropython it seems as though the code is near the memory limit of the ESP8266.

I welcome suggestions and corrections.  The entire project it to match up to a Home-Assistant installation.
